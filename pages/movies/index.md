# Movies

## Recommendations

I'll be trying to avoid adding too many universally acclaimed or super popular items here. I enjoy most of those and most people probably know them already.

I will put very popular movies or even Oscar winners here if I *really* think they deserve a watch from people who may have missed them or wrote them off.


#### Palm Springs (2020)

#### Parasite (2019)

#### Get Out (2017)

#### Kubo & The 2 Strings (2017)

#### Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)

#### Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2007)


## Methods

When possible, I put most of mine and my family's favorite media in [Plex](/pages/plex/index.md).
