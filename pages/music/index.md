See the end of this page for all the albums I keep MP3s of


## Curation

With so much music it is HARD to keep up with all of it.

I enjoy using many "updated weekly" playlists on streaming services, however I value the "human connection" of a curator as well. There's a big difference between the next song starting on a playlist and a DJ introducing the song with some context.

Peter Rosenberg (who is 1/2 of the Juan Ep podcast duo that I shout out on my [Podcasts](/pages/podcasts/index.md) page) also hosts a dope weekly 2am rappity-rap hip-hop show on Hot 97. He uploads them to his [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/Rosenbergradio/).

I also love much of the content and curation (including a weekly [Roundup](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0lXnoKdWejjer3S3xfiOex?si=0f4ba5a98f95485f) playlist on Spotify) from [Okayplayer](https://www.okayplayer.com/). Here's some [background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayplayer) on Okayplayer.

## Digital Listening

### Last.FM

I use [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/) to track my listens

* Analytics on your music listening
* It misses physical listening but that’s ok

### Apple Music

I use Apple Music to listen. The primary reason is that it allows rating songs, editing metadata, and uploading your own MP3s

* Ratings and MP3s 
* Ratings
	* Link to my upcoming ratings on alej.hiphop
	* Future advanced smart playlists


#### Marvis

I use [Marvis](/pages/marvis/index.md) app to take advantage of the aforementioned ratings and metadata.



## Analog Listening

### Vinyl

See all about it here: [Vinyl](/pages/vinyl/index.md)


### Psuedo Analog

I like creating physical representations of music and using those to physically explore and decide what to listen to

I create small LEGO covers.

I create larger drinking coasters. I like using these to appreciate my favorite covers, very similar to vinyl. However unlike vinyl, they take up less space, and they're not bounded by availability/price.


# All the albums I keep MP3s of

Continued from above, here are all the albums I keep MP3s of

I keep them in MP3 form for my car USB player

I also like having them for when I eventually check out of the streaming age and keep my own "owned" media
