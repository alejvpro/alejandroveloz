# Funko

I like Funko POPs as a decorative way of appreciating things.

They are small, which I appreciate in the spirit of [Minimalism](/pages/minimalism/index.md), however they can very quickly get out of hand and take up too much space, especially if displayed in their boxes.

I personally don't keep mine in their boxes. I went overboard collecting at first but have since scaled back to tidy sized collection.

Like [Collections](/pages/collections/index.md) in general, I think if I don't get a chance to see or display a given item in your collection at least once a year, then that means I have too many.

And I don't have the space or appreciation to line my walls with these, so I really just save them for my absolute favorite themes, or very fun unique _whimsical_ designs.

One thing I found to help prevent me from buying many, was just keeping track of and bookmarking Funko's that I like and appreciate and are happy exist, but that I don't need to own.

I've found that keeping a collection on a site like [PopPriceGuide](https://www.poppriceguide.com) helps scratch the itch of collecting, without actually needing to own each and every Funko.

With that in mind, here are some of my favorites, even many I don't own.
