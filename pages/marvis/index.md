I'll be doing a huge write-up on this app someday, but for now in general:

It is a 3rd party music player which let's you interact with your Apple Music songs in unique and powerful ways.

Simpler, it lets you make smart playlists, smart album groupings, smart sections, smart everything!

Some examples:

I have a playlist of all songs from the last 30 days, with at least a 3 star rating, and I can change it to sort by date added, play count, any meta-data item.

I have a section which lists all albums that are "complete" (have all the songs in the album saved), with average rating greater than 3.

The possibilities are endless.

If you love fiddling with your music organization, this is the app for you:
