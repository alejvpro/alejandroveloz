# Collections

I enjoy having a minimal amount of items, which I talk about in [Minimalism](/pages/minimalism/index.md), but I also enjoy keeping small tidy physical collections of some personally memorable items.

TODO: add more overall philosophy on how I collect, how I've gone overboard and scaled back before, how I usually like physically small things, etc.
