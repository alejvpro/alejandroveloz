# Coins

I've liked coins since childhood and have recently started learning more about them.

The internet is full of numerous resources for this.

I like these 2 sites:

[Numista](https://en.numista.com/) is a cool site which has a catalog of nearly every coin from every country

[Ken Polsson](http://kpolsson.com/coins/) has great lists of coins by demonination and their changes over time (for example you can see the full history of the US $0.25 coin [here](http://kpolsson.com/coins/usa/usa25c.htm))

Wikipedia is also an amazing resource with even more detail per country and coin.

And recently I've been enjoying a physical copy of ["The Red Book"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_Book_of_United_States_Coins).


### US Coins

I like the concept of "type collecting" and trying to find examples of all the given "types" and designs of a coin.

This is how Ken Polsson define's type collecting:

> Coins can be collected in various manners: coins for circulation versus coins for collectors, individual coins versus sets or rolls, circulated coins versus mint state, every date and mint mark versus major types. This Web site presents information to help with assembling a "type" collection of individual circulated United States of America coins.
>
> What is "type" collecting? Type collecting is assembling coins of different designs. A type set generally excludes minor variations that include the same basic design. Examples are date change, and mint marks. Major variations in coin composition (such as a switch from 80% silver to copper-nickel) constitute a type change, but a minor variation (such as the ratios of copper, tin, and zinc in 1940s 1-cent coins) do not represent a type change.
>
> Different collectors will have their own opinions of what coins should be included in a type collection. The following is my interpretation of significant year-to-year changes in American circulating coins.

My favorite Mexican coins are the circulating ones with Mesoamerican designs.

Mexico made many amazing Mesoamerican coins in the 1980's:
