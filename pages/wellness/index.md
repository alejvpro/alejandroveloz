# Wellness

### Mindfulness

I try to practice mindfulness consistently. I enjoy the guided meditations that are common on many apps and I've bounced around a few of them but currently use only one

### Journaling

I find journally really helpful.

I first started daily journaling with this type of notebook:

[Dawn and Dusk](https://www.amazon.com/Knock-Dawn-Dusk-Daily-Journal/dp/168349007X)

It encourages you to use as you start your day and end it, which I enjoyed.

After completing that year, I now use this wild [Hobonichi 2021-2015 Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2021/pc/detail_cover/fb21_s_jan/) journal which let's you see how your journal entries have developed on a given day over a 5 year span.

As of early 2022, I am going strong on my second year!

Lastly I've also been using an app named "365 & me" which asks you one question per day, and repeats the same questions each year. I enjoy the mental check-ins, but I don't really put it in the same category of wellness journaling as the 2 journals above. I just include it here for the "daily" aspect.
