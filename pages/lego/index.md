# LEGO

I like collecting LEGO minifigures.

This is as opposed to LEGO sets. That is a hobby all it's own, but it's not for me.

I do enjoy building and displaying LEGO sets, but I like keeping figures more than keeping entire sets.

When it comes to mini-figures, I see them very similar to [Funko](/pages/funko/index.md), minimal way of appreciating things.

Many things I said there also apply to LEGO.

In fact I should probably update my [Collections](/pages/collections/index.md) page in general to reflect the commonalities between my collections and reduce redundancies.

But the reasons I usually like LEGO even more than Funko are that 

1. They've always been there for me
2. They're smaller!
3. They're more affordable


Here a few of my favorite LEGO minifigures.

_As opposed to Funko POPs, I DO have all of these minifigures (for many of the reasons above). You may also note some overlap between my Funkos and my LEGOs._
