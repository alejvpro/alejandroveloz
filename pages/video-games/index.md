# Video Games

I grew up playing console video games, took a bit of a hiatus with mobile games, and the Nintendo Switch and some PC gaming friends have brought me back around lately.

Similar to my Movie and TV sections, I won't give recommendations here on the MOST popular games since most people alreday know them (also I haven't played many of them the past 10 years during my time away from consoles), but here's what I do have!
