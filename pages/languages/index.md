# Languages

In theory I like learning languages. In reality I think what I really enjoy is learning about languages.


## Language Learning

I took spanish classes in high school.

Since then, my learning has been via apps.


#### Duolingo

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) has been a great app for learning Spanish vocabulary and refreshing on different tenses.

It was also very helpful in learning the Korean alphabet (or Hangul) and the Arabic alphabet.

However when it came to Arabic at least (which has many dialects), it did not match the Levantine dialect I wanted to learn.


#### Mango

For that I switched to the AMAZING [Mango Languages](https://mangolanguages.com/). Mango did not explicitly teach the Arabic alphabet but it immediately started teaching me relevant and practical words for traveling. Most importantly it has a Levantine-specific Arabic course.


#### Movies & TV

While traditional "book learning" is necessary, I've found another great tool to help with learning from other forms of media

This awesome [Language Reactor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-reactor/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm) plugin allows you to watch non-english movies and shows on Netflix while viewing subtitles in multiple languages.

This let's me watch [La Casa de las Flores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_Flowers_(TV_series)) in Spanish while viewing English and Spanish subtitles.

The plugin also let's you rewind/fast-foward one subtitle at a time as well as let's you bookmark specific sentences and words.  


#### Music

Finally I'm hoping to find a good source of translated lyrics (Genius.com may do the trick, I haven't checked) because I want to see if I can get some good vocab/motivation from Calle 13.


## Ancient Writing

Ancient writing systems fascinate me.

I'm learning about, or want to learn about, the following ones:

* Egyptian hieroglyphs
* Mayan glyphs
* Cuneiform
