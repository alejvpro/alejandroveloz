# Jerseys

I had few jerseys growing up, mostly US and Mexican soccer ones.

After showing some cool modern jerseys to a friend, he introduced me to the world of kit culture in soccer.

I still don't have many jerseys but I do appreciate some with really cool stories and meanings.

Here are some of my favorites:
