Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

My goal is to easily share cool stuff and information with friends and family.

If you happen to have read everything, or are just curious what I've been up to, all past updates will be tracked here:
[Changes](changes.md)

### Future

My next big goal is to take this web site beyond simple text and pictures and slowly re-create the magic and fun of PC games from my childhood, creating alternative fun ways to browse the content.

In the meantime these pages are displayed using a heirachy system. For this reasons you'll notice some repeat pages above, such as [Vinyl](vinyl.md) as a medium of [Music](music.md) as well as one of my [Collections](collections).
