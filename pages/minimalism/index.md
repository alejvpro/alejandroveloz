# Minimalism

This is also going to turn into a long post but for now.

I try to only keep things that *I use*. This has helped me reduce lots of clutter in my life.

I really do think Minimalism can be as simple as that: clothes, tools, stationery, the basics.

I think the real challenge comes in picking what you actually value beyond that.

I personally like to expand the definition of what *I use* to be more lenient of collectibles or material items.

However my main criteria on material things is that I actually enjoy them, and actually see them at least once a year. I really try to avoid having things boxed up that never see the light of day.


#### Small Collectibles

For that reason, many of my small collections end up being physically small like [LEGO](lego.md) minifigures, and seasonally rotated.

I like rotating small items like LEGO's, souvenirs, and plush items through my desk at work through out the year for example.

One thing I like to do to keep the size of miscellaneous collectibles is to keep their size down enough to fit in small containers that have their own collectibility.

A very fun way I've found to do this is by storing them in themed mugs. For example I keep some of my favorite small trinkets in the following mugs.

* Star Wars BB-8 mug


#### Digital Collectibles

I also enjoy keeping some forms of collections in *digital* form. No this does not include NFTs, but yes I do get some of the same enjoyment that NFT collectors get from their collections, but there's no money complicating things.

I use the app Bear, which I talk about in [Productivity](/pages/productivity/index.md), to keep fun notes full of real world items that I appreciate, but don't want or need to own. This includes many things I don't own but catalog on this site on the [Collections](/pages/collections/index.md) page.


#### Digital Formats

I also like moving many items from the physical world to the digital ones.

The best example of this is TV and Movie media. I'm much happier with a well organized [Plex](/pages/plex/index.md) collection than I am with a shelf/wall full of DVD's and Blu Rays.

I also enjoy more "transient" or casual books to be in e-book form.

However I still am a huge fan of staying physical for books like coffee table books which benefit from print photos and large size format. I have some of my favorites on the [Books](/pages/books/index.md) page.
