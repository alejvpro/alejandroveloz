# UNO

You may have known there are TONS of themed UNO sets.

But did you know there is a growing number of "limited edition" versions?

I personally have only 2 UNO sets, but I do enjoy some of the limited designs, even though I'm not a huge fan of the "limited" and drop-culture aspect of some of them.


### Favorites

Between the "limited editions" and  the general themed sets, here are some of my favorites:

Old Harry Potter Box

Basquiat

The Hundreds

Moncler

Star Wars Force Awakens

Coco

Nightmare Before Christmas

Minions

Tokyo Olympics

Hellow Kitty

### Notable

And here is a list of all the UNO sets that have piqued my interest.

I like watching for new sets and adding them out of curiousity.

I think I'm drawn to themed UNO sets in general because I loved UNO growing up and I like the idea that any one of these sets might be the set someone is introduced to UNO by and grows up loving.

TODO: add the 10's of sets that I've cataloged and dated.
