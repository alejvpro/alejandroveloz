# Hobbies

It's tough to categorize hobbies.

[Collecting](/pages/collections/index.md) is a hobby. Watching [TV Shows](/pages/tv-shows/index.md) and [Movies](/pages/movies/index.md) is a hobby. Listening to [Music](/pages/music/index.md) is a hobby. [Learning](/pages/learning/index.md) is a hobby, etc etc.

Most of those involve consuming.

So I'll use this page to capture the things that are more creative/output driven.
