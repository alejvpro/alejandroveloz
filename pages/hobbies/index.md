# Hobbies

It's tough to categorize hobbies.

[Collecting](/pages/collections/index.md) is a hobby. Watching [TV Shows](/pages/tv-shows/index.md) and [Movies](/pages/movies/index.md) is a hobby. Listening to [Music](/pages/music/index.md) is a hobby. [Learning](/pages/learning/index.md) is a hobby, etc etc.

Most of those involve consuming.

So I'll use this page to capture the things that are more creative/output driven.

## Free Time

It's tough to come by free time. And when you do, sometimes I forget all the things I said I wanted to do when I didn't have it.

I have a note full of lists of my favorite creative hobbies and ways to spend time: reading, writing, making music, biking, etc.

However on days when I go offline, sometimes I still want a "list" of recommendations to do next with my free time (on the days when I'm so lucky to have it)

### Charms

For that, I've got some of these great mini tiny little "floating locket charms" as they're called.

TODO: add photos of my "used" ones and my "cool non-used" ones.

So sometimes I look to this (repurposed pill) case for inspiration and take my day take me towards whichever charm I pull out :)
