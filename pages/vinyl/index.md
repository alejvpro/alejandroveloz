# Vinyl

_The internet will correct you if you use "vinyl" instead of "vinyl record", but I think we're well past the point of establishing "vinyl" as a term on its own, so that's what I use._

I love vinyl as a physical way to hold onto my absolute favorite albums especially when they overlap with some of my absolute favorite cover art.

Like many of my collections, I once went overboard with it until realizing there are only so many records you can keep out on the shelves and actually play often.

I've now got an extremely tight collection (\~30) of my favorite vinyl records.


### Culture

I like the culture around it when it comes to awesome things like Record Store Day.

However vinyl prices have been going up and drop-culture and limited pressings have been less appealing lately.


### Resources

[Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is cool for looking up vinyls and cataloging your own collection.
