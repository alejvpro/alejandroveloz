# Data Storage

Todo: Add details on latest data storage "strategies".


This is an old diagram, but a good starting point for keeping multiple backups of your data:

(No it's not really trademarked, that was just for fun)

I plan to make a tool to let people fiddle around with potential strategies.


### Back-ups of the internet

Everything above is about backing up my own data.

This small sections is about backing up information that I like that "belongs" to the internet.

If I'm interested in something, I usually save them to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/save).

For example, most places I've linked to on alejandroveloz.com are backed up on the Wayback Machine.

I've experienced 404's and lost pages on past favorite articles or favorite collectibles and this had led to me just tossing most links into the Wayback Machine.

It doesn't cost you anything and it feels like part of being a helpful internet citizen.
