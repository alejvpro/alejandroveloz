# Productivity

Ways I do things.


### Notes

I use [Bear](https://bear.app/) for all my notes.

I use it over stock apps because of it's amazing inter-note linking, ease of note link copying, and use of Markdown* format.

* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is the text-formatting I use on alejandroveloz.com as well as my blog.


### Reminders

I use the stock Reminders app to keep track of basically any recurring task or habit.

Daily/weekly/monthly, etc


## Going Offline

I enjoy digital forms of productivity because they're often so much more powerful than analog ones. For example, text-search, copy-paste, images, etc.

However for me those can often become consuming and sometimes more effort goes into organizing and re-organizing your tasks than actually accomplishing them.

For that reason, sometimes I like to take things offline.

That's when I like to appreciate the stationery I use, like:

* [Moleskine](/pages/moleskine/index.md)
* [Blackwing](/pages/blackwing/index.md)
