# Productivity

Ways I do things.


### Notes

I use [Bear](https://bear.app/) for all my notes.

I use it over stock apps because of it's amazing inter-note linking, ease of note link copying, and use of Markdown* format.

* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is the text-formatting I use on alejandroveloz.com as well as my blog.


### Reminders

I use the stock Reminders app to keep track of basically any recurring task or habit.

Daily/weekly/monthly, etc


## Going Offline

I enjoy digital forms of productivity because they're often so much more powerful than analog ones. For example, text-search, copy-paste, images, etc.

However for me those can often become consuming and sometimes more effort goes into organizing and re-organizing your tasks than actually accomplishing them.

For that reason, sometimes I like to take things offline.

### Charms

I have a note full of lists of my favorite creative hobbies and ways to spend time: reading, writing, making music, biking, etc.

However on days when I go offline, sometimes I still want a "list" of recommendations to do next with my free time (on the days when I'm so lucky to have it)

For that, I've got some of these great mini tiny little "floating locket charms" as they're called.

So sometimes I look to this (repurposed pill) case for inspiration and take my day take me towards whichever charm I pull out :)
