# TV Shows


## Recommendations

These won't necessarily be my top 10 TV shows, but they will be TV shows I either have something to say about or that I think deserve an extra nudge in recommendation if you haven't seen them. Even though I love many of them, I usually won't include universally praised or known shows like The Wire, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc. There's not much more to add to the conversation that hasn't been said.
